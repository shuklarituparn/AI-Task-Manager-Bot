# ü§ñ AI Task Manager Bot

The AI Task Manager Bot üìãü§ñ is designed to assist users in managing their tasks on Telegram. It allows task addition and deletion using specific commands. The bot utilizes Redis 5 as its database. Additionally, it leverages LangChain and GIGACHAT from Sber as AI models.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To start the bot, you can follow these steps:

### Manual Run

1. Ensure you have all the necessary key files for the bot.
2. Run the `main.py` file in your preferred Python environment.


## Bot Commands (Russian) üá∑üá∫

The bot understands commands in Russian. Here are the available commands:

- **–î–æ–±–∞–≤—å –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∏ –∫ —Å–ø–∏—Å–∫—É:** –í—Ö–æ–¥ –≤ —Ä–µ–∂–∏–º –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∏.
- **–£–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å –∏–∑ —Å–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞:** –í—Ö–æ–¥ –≤ —Ä–µ–∂–∏–º —É–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∏ –∏–∑ —Å–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞.
- **–ó–æ–≤–∏ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫–∞:** –í—ã–∑–æ–≤ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫–∞ (–ø–æ —É–º–æ–ª—á–∞–Ω–∏—é –∏–º—è –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫–∞ - –ê–∞–¥–∏).
- **–ü–æ–∫–∞–∂–∏ –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∏:** –ü—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö –∑–∞–¥–∞—á.

Additionally, the following commands can be used to interact with the bot:

- `/start`: –ó–∞–ø—É—Å–∫ –±–æ—Ç–∞.
- `/help`: –ü–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∏.
- `/gen`: –ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è –æ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ –±–æ—Ç–∞.
- `/delete_all`: –£–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤—Å–µ—Ö –∑–∞–¥–∞—á –∏–∑ —Å–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞.

## Usage üìù

### Task Management

When entering the "–î–æ–±–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ" task mode, any input will be added to the database. To exit the mode, input "End". The bot remains in the specified mode until it receives the "end" command.

### Additional Notes ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- Ensure all necessary key files are plugged in while running the bot, especially when using the Docker container.
- For any assistance or queries, feel free to utilize the `/help` command.
